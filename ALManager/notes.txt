Hi Julian, thanks for watching. The login method in the auth service sets the jwt in local storage. isUserLoggedIn$ is 
initially set to false. You could implement the ngOnInit lifecycle method and check if the token exists in local storage, 
nd if it does, you could call next on the isUserLoggedIn$ subject. I've done this in my latest LinkedIn Clone project, 
which also uses Angular, you could check the code out on my GitHub (link in description) if you need help. 
The logic is - getting a token from local storage - check it hasn't expired - then set the next subject. 
The subscriptions to the subject then should propagate the correct values throughout your codebase i.e. to the nav bar. 
Thanks for pointing this out. Surprised I missed this, it has been some time since I created this, and just had a quick 
look at the repo. Hope that helps!
